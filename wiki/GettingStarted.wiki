#summary How to start work with ajdmserver
=Installing dmServer=
	Please refer to http://static.springsource.com/projects/dm-server/1.0.x/getting-started/html/ch02.html

=Installing Eclipse tools=
	Please refer to http://static.springsource.com/projects/dm-server/1.0.x/getting-started/html/ch02s04.html

=Deploying ajdmserver=
ajdmserver.jar exposes two services:
   * MappingStrategy
   * ServerManager

Mapping strategy is a service that implements  [http://asterisk-java.org/latest/apidocs/org/asteriskjava/fastagi/MappingStrategy.html org.asteriskjava.fastagi.MappingStrategy] interface. It discovers and obtains AgiScripts. Each AgiServer has its own MappingStrategy instance. 

ServerManager is a service that runs and stops AgiServers instances. It can be use to list servers and its properties.

To install services deploy ajdmserver.jar in dmSpringSOurce Server web interface (if server is installed on localhost admin interface is located under link http://localhost:8080/admin)
       
----
=Deploying XMLConfServerStarter=
ServerStarter is responsible for creating AgiServer instances defined in simple XML file on dmServer startup. 
XML files with servers definitions must be located at:
  *  /etc/agi-servers.xml under Unix systems
  *  c:\agi-servers.xml under Windows systems
Before deploying this bundle you have to create config file to have your agi server (or servers) working. Example of such file can be found [ServerStarterXMLConfFile here].

To install this bundle deploy it in web admin interface.
*IMPORTANT* Deploy of this bundle must be done after deploying ajdmserver.jar file

        * create new folder 'spring' in META-INF folder
        * create new xml file inside spring folder, its name must match `*context.xml` pattern
        * xml file syntax example and explanation can be found [script-context here]
